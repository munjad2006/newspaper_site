            <p style="font-size: large;"><b>Published:</b> April 16, 2025</p>

            <hr>
            <p style="font-size: large;">
                The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has projected a significant slowdown in
                global economic growth, forecasting a deceleration to 2.3% in 2025 from 2.8% in 2024. This downturn is
                attributed to escalating trade tensions and rising policy uncertainties, particularly stemming from
                recent U.S. tariff policies. Earlier in April, U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on
                numerous countries, including imposing a 145% levy on Chinese imports. These measures have unsettled
                financial markets and raised concerns about a potential U.S. recession. UNCTAD warns that continued
                restrictive trade practices and geopolitical economic confrontations could disrupt international trade
                flows and supply chains, further dampening global economic activity. The agency also urged the U.S.
                administration to exempt the poorest and smallest economies from tariffs, arguing they have minimal
                effect on U.S. trade objectives.</p>

            <p style="font-size: large;">The report highlights that the global economy is already facing challenges from
                rising inflation, high energy prices, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. UNCTAD's
                Secretary-General, Rebeca Grynspan, emphasized the need for a coordinated global response to address
                these challenges and promote sustainable economic growth.</p>

            <p style="font-size: large;">The report also notes that the global economy is projected to grow by 2.3% in
                2025, down from the previous forecast of 2.8%. This slowdown is expected to be driven by a combination
                of factors, including rising inflation, high energy prices, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19
                pandemic.</p>

            <p style="font-size: large;">UNCTAD's report highlights the need for a coordinated global response to
                address
                these challenges and promote sustainable economic growth. The agency also calls for increased
                investment in infrastructure, education, and technology to support long-term growth.</p>

            <p style="font-size: large;">In conclusion, the UNCTAD report underscores the importance of addressing trade
                tensions and policy uncertainties to ensure a stable and sustainable global economic environment. The
                agency's recommendations for increased investment in infrastructure, education, and technology are
                crucial for promoting long-term growth and resilience in the face of ongoing challenges.</p>

            <h2>2. U.S. Stock Markets Tumble After New Export Restrictions on China</h2>

            <hr>
            <p style="font-size: large;">
                Global financial markets experienced turmoil following U.S. President Donald Trump’s tightened export
                restrictions on chips to China, causing sharp declines in global stocks and the U.S. dollar. Nvidia
                revealed it anticipates a $5.5 billion loss due to the ban on its AI chips in China. The World Trade
                Organization (WTO) warned that the tariffs could reverse global trade growth, lowering its forecast from
                +2.7% to a -0.2% decline.</p>

            <p style="font-size: large;">In response, stock markets across the U.S., Europe, and Asia dropped, with
                Nvidia's shares falling 6.5%. The dollar weakened, while gold surged to a record high above $3,300 an
                ounce amid growing investor uncertainty. The UN also forecast slower global economic growth of just 2.3%
                in 2025.</p>

            <p style="font-size: large;">Meanwhile, UK inflation cooled to 2.6%, and eurozone inflation to 2.2%,
                encouraging expectations of interest rate cuts by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.
                However, economists warned inflation could rise again due to new tariffs and rising household costs.</p>

            <p style="font-size: large;">In response to U.S. tariffs, China criticized U.S. trade practices and
                appointed a new trade negotiator. Additional economic data revealed a U.S. retail sales spike in March,
                but a decline in industrial production. Elsewhere, Spotify suffered a major service outage, and water
                pollution incidents in the UK rose sharply in 2024.</p>

            <p style="font-size: large;">In conclusion, the tightening of export restrictions on China has led to a
                significant decline in global stock markets and the U.S. dollar, with Nvidia facing substantial losses.
                The WTO's warning of a potential reversal in global trade growth adds to the uncertainty. As markets
                react to these developments, investors are advised to stay informed and consider the potential impact on
                their portfolios.</p>

            <h2>3. Climate Change Leads to 41 Additional Days of Extreme Heat in 2024</h2>

            <hr>
            <p style="font-size: large;">
                A recent report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) revealed that climate change has caused
                an
                additional 41 days of extreme heat in 2024, with the average global temperature reaching 1.4 degrees
                Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The report highlights the urgent need for action to combat climate
                change and its devastating effects on the planet.</p>
            <p style="font-size: large;">The WMO's report emphasizes that the increase in extreme heat days is a direct
                result of human-induced climate change, which has led to more frequent and severe heatwaves across the
                globe. The report also notes that the Arctic region has experienced particularly severe warming, with
                temperatures rising by 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>
            <p style="font-size: large;">The report calls for immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
                limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as outlined in the Paris Agreement. The WMO urges countries
                to accelerate their efforts to transition to renewable energy sources and implement sustainable
                practices
                to mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p>
            <p style="font-size: large;">In conclusion, the WMO's report serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need
                to
                address climate change and its consequences. The additional 41 days of extreme heat in 2024 highlight
                the
                pressing need for global cooperation and action to combat this critical issue.</p>
